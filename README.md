# DroidStar Vocoder Plugin

The **DroidStar Vocoder Plugin** is a versatile backup vocoder tool designed to enhance the functionality of the DroidStar project. This plugin is a valuable addition to the DroidStar ecosystem, providing users with enhanced vocoding capabilities.

## What is DroidStar?

[DroidStar](https://github.com/lu9dce/DroidStar)

This software connects to M17, Fusion (YSF/FCS, DN and VW modes are supported), DMR, P25, NXDN, D-STAR (REF/XRF/DCS) reflectors and AllStar nodes (as an IAX2 client) over UDP. It is compatible with all of the AMBE USB devices out there (ThumbDV, DVstick 30, DVSI, etc). It also supports MMDVM modems and can be used as a hotspot, or as a stand-alone transceiver via direct mode to the MMDVM device. This software is open source and uses the cross platform C++ library called Qt. It will build and run on Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, and iOS. No USB device support for iOS though (AMBE vocoder or MMDVM). It should also build and run on any other posix platform that has Qt avilable (xxxBSD, Solaris, etc). This software is provided as-is and no support is available.

This software makes use of software from a number of other open source software projects, including MMDVMHost, MMDVM_CM, mvoice, and others. Not only is software from these projects being used directly, but learning about the various network protocols and encoding/decoding of the various protocols was only possible thanks to the authors of all of these software projects.
